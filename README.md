# Naming Conventions

* You have to give every method a Prefix
* Prefix's can only be folder names from the home folder
* There are some secondary Prefixes you should use:
	* Prefix\_fm\_Description (form method)
	* Prefix\_fo_\Description (form object)
	* Prefix\_LB\_Description_Actions
	* Prefix\_LB\_Description_Data
	* Prefix\_LB\_Description_View
* Exceptions
	* Each prefix gets a compiler method named Compiler\_prefix
* Error names can only use these prefix's

# Input forms

* The top of one text field should be 22 pixels under the top of the text field above it
